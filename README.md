# World Happiness, GDP per Capita, and Life Expectancy

This project investigates the relationship between GDP per capita, happiness scores, and life expectancy using data from the World Happiness Reports (2015–2019).

## Research Question
To what extent does GDP per capita influence happiness score and life expectancy?

## Data
The dataset combines World Happiness data across multiple years (2015–2019), including:

- GDP per capita
- Happiness score
- Healthy life expectancy
- Social support
- Freedom
- Trust in government
- Generosity

The data was cleaned and merged into a single dataset for analysis.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and merging of multi-year datasets
- Exploratory data analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization using scatterplots

## Results
The analysis shows strong positive correlations between GDP per capita and both happiness score and life expectancy. However, additional social and political factors also contribute to overall well-being.
